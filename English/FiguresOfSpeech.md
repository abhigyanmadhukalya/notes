# Figures of Speech

*A few notes about the figures of speech or the ones that I need.*

## Simile

**A simile is a figure of speech that uses comparison**. In a simile, we use two specific words “like” and “as” to compare two unlikely things, that actually have nothing in common.

Examples:

- quite like a mouse

- as brave as a lion

## Metaphor

A metaphor and a simile are quite similar actually. **A metaphor also uses compares to things that are in no way similar. It does so to bring out the symbolism**. A metaphor is a word or phrase used to show its similarity to another thing. It helps to explain an idea, but if you take a metaphor at its literal meaning it will sound absurd.

Examples:

- **Alex is chicken**: This means that Alex is frightened or scared to do something an not literallly a chicken

## Personification

**Giving human characteristics to a non-living thing is called personification**.

Examples:

- Why is your plant pouting in the corner?

- The hair on my arms stood after the performance

## 

### Hyperbole

**We use hyperboles to emphasize the importance or overstate something**. This exaggerates claims and statements are never meant to be taken at their literal meaning

Examples:

- He's gotten as thin as a needle

- Those shoes cost a king's ransom

- For the millionth time, clean the kitchen

## Onomatopeia

This is a figure of speech where words or phrases indicate sounds. Often to bring about more imagery and better describe a setting, authors use words to involve all five of our senses. **Onomatopeia refers to those words that imitate the sounds of an object or person**.

Examples:

- The bees buzzed around the garden.

- The mouse was squeaking around the house.

- He slamed the door with a thud.

## Antithesis

[Antithesis](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/antithesis/) is a literary technique that **places opposite things or ideas next to one another** in order to draw out their contrast.

Example:

- "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times ..." - Charles Dickens in *A Tale of Two Cities*

## Alliteration

**Alliteration is the repeating of consonant sounds right next to each other, which creates a memorable or melodic effect.**

Examples:

- She sells seashells by the seashore

- Rocky road

- No nonsense

- Tough talk

- quick question

- big bucks

## Apostrophe

**Apostrophe as a figure of speech is when a character addresses someone or something that isn’t present or cannot respond**. The character might speak to someone deceased, an inanimate object, or a concept.

Examples:

- "O Romeo, Romeo, wherefort art thou Romeo?" - William Shakespear in *Romeo and Juiliet*

## Circumlocution

**Circumlocution is the use of purposely sounding wordly description**. You can think of it as talking in circles

Examples:

- In the *Harry Potter* series, most characters don’t say Lord Voldemort’s name; instead, they use this circumlocution: “He Who Must Not Be Named.”

## Irony

**Irony is a situation that subverts a reader's expectations**.

Example: One of the characters in your story is a hypochondriac, always convinced that they have an exotic and uncurable disease. An ironic ending for that character would be if they died of a common cold.

## Oxymoron

An oxymoron is a pharse that uses two contradictory words to create a new meaning

Examples:

- That cake was awfully good

- He royally messed up
